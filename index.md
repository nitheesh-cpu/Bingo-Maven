## About this Project

This project is a simulation of the well-known game Bingo. This project is built using Java Swing to display a Graphical User Interface. The application allows the user to print Bingo cards and simulate a Bingo game, showing the user the drawn numbers, the cards that won, and the day it won.

### How to Use

Upon starting the program, the user is prompted with four spaces for the random game seed, the number of cards, the number of winners, and number of days. There is an option to choose which file type you want when printing cards, and a help menu with detailed instructions and a theme chooser to change the look and feel of the application. If the user wants to print cards, they can enter an amount of cards, and a random game seed and press 'Print Cards', otherwise they must fill in all the blanks and press 'Play Simulation'. When pressing 'Print Cards' the file(s) will be saved to the same directory of the application, in a folder named "BingoCards". When pressing 'Play Simulation', a new window will replace the menu, prompting the user to draw a bingo number and displaying the drawn numbers and the card number for the cards that have won. The user can move view all the cards they requested and upon completion of the game, the user will be shown the day each card will win and the day each number is drawn.
